## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- javaScript

### What I learned

Whith this is project, I learned basic concepts of JavaScript. I was proud to have managed to use JS, even if I did it together with the Thomas Sankara channel. I learned how to register an event listener. So the part of the code I'm most proud of is:

```JS
buttonSubmit.addEventListener("click", () => {
  thankYou.classList.remove("hidden");
  mainContainer.style.display = "none";
});
buttonRateAgain.addEventListener("click", () => {
  thankYou.classList.add("hidden");
  mainContainer.style.display = "block";
});
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
I also understood how to make containers responsive without using media queries. In this case, I only needed to put a max-width in the containers. This was satisfactory.

### Continued development

I intend to continue developing my JS skills and improve my ability to make a project responsive.
